# FireSpreadSimulation
Determines effects of environmental and fuel characteristic performance measures on the spread of a wildfire, Matlab 

Folders:

     Figures display results of simulation 

     Figures - Area:
  
         Includes graphs displaying how the area burnt by the fire changes with each performance measure
      
     Figures - Rate:
  
         Includes graphs displaying how the rate of spread of the fire changes with each performance measure
      
     Figures - Shape:
  
         Includes images/grids of the land burnt, what the shape of the fire looks like for the minimums and 
         maximums for each performance measure
      
     FireAnimationVersion:
  
         Run script FireSpreadSim
      
         Executes an animation of the fire burning through the land given the specified parameters
      
     StatisticsCollectionVersion:
  
         FuelTypesVersion:
         
               Includes version of the script FireSpreadSim.m and runSim.m used to calculate and display
               statistics on the area burnt, rate of fire spread, and shape of the fire according to 
               each of the 13 fuel/vegetation type. Bar graphs and images used.
      
         WindVersion:
         
               Includes version of the script FireSpreadSim.m and runSim.m used to calculate and display
               statistics on the area burnt, rate of fire spread, and shape of the fire according to 
               each wind speed, ranging from 0 to 91 ft/s. Line graphs and images used.
               
         All other files are to be used with the FireSpreadSim.m and runSim.m from one of the above versions.
         Only the fuel types and wind speed source code versions are listed, the results of these and the other
         performance measures are dislayed in the figures.
